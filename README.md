# navbar-jerry
 responsive navigation bar (navbar) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The HTML structure includes a nav element containing:

A logo wrapped in an anchor tag.
An unordered list (ul) with navigation links (li elements).
A div with the class burger for the hamburger menu icon.

The CSS styles the navbar:

Sets the layout with Flexbox for horizontal alignment.
Styles the logo and navigation links with colors, fonts, and spacing.
Adds styles for the hamburger menu icon, which is hidden on larger screens and displayed on smaller screens using media queries.
Uses transformations and transitions for smooth opening and closing of the mobile menu.

The JavaScript enables interactivity:

Selects the hamburger menu icon and the navigation links.
Adds an event listener to toggle the visibility of the navigation links and animate them when the hamburger icon is clicked.
